About LightVC

LightVC is a lightweight model-view-controller (MVC) framework without the model. This decoupling allows any model or object relation mapping (ORM) tool to be used, including none at all if one is not needed.

LightVC is comparable to, although unlike, CakePHP, Code Igniter, symfony, Solar, and Zend Framework to name a few. It's major difference is that it does not try to be a full "Web framework" and instead tries to solve the need for an MVC that isn't coupled to other tools.

As such, LightVC does not couple itself to any non-VC related classes either, such as those for managing sessions, form helpers, and so on. This promotes code reuse by allowing existing code for such tasks be used.

LightVC has been in use in production since early 2007, and is now being released to the public under the FreeBSD license.
